# gesture-controlled-youtube-player
its a clear cut project that it can control youtube playing with the hand gesture.. 
what i did is that i turned the youtube shortcut keys a main thing for my project they are just triggered by the hand gesture ...
i took  a little bit of help from AI for doing the job and some scraping thing from the internet although tutorials were available in youtube i only used a chunk of them tried on my own to do so that this took a bitlong time...
you guys can just copy this code and paste in yours or clone the git i think and try on your own ..for the voting  there is a demo 
and the project lacks one thing the switiching between videos previous one next one cause those gestures are mismatching and the swiping thing isn't beingrecognized easily i will fix that thing soon if i get time.....
